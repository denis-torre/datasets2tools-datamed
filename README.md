### What is the Datasets2Tools Chrome Extension?
The Datasets2Tools Chrome Extension is a browser extension which enriches dataset search pages and dataset landing pages of biomedical repositories.  It embeds interfaces which allow users to find, access and share the results of analyses run by computational tools on the biomedical datasets stored in the repository.
